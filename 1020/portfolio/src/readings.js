`Week 2 - Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts

In his text, Ulises Carrión refutes the widespread belief that Mail Art is nothing more than art disguised within a mail. Instead, he suggests the postal system is the work's support and not the medium. Like a piece of wood or a canvas within a painting, the post office is the carrier of the piece that supports it but is not the piece itself. He suggests that the importance of Post Art is not the use of the postcard format or what it is but what it occasions: exchanges, actions and reactions that Mail Art instigates.

Carrión challenges artists who reduce Mail Art down to simply producing postcards because that misses the point of the Mail Art. For Carrión, the actual strength of Mail Art is the way it intersects with the vast postal system, the Big Monster of communication and distribution control. Each time an artist posts something, it is at once an act of imagination and a confrontation of that system of rules and bureaucracy and power.

From the reading, the idea that the value of Mail Art isn't found in its aesthetics or craftsmanship, but rather the "echo" it creates (the reaction, connection, and dialogue that is returned) was perhaps the idea that stood out the most. It makes Mail Art not necessarily a lone work of art and rather a collaborative practice that disturbs the ordinary use of the mail. At the very same time, Carrión is careful not to describe it "cheap" or "democratic" because it has to be of value based on whether or not it genuinely produces valid work and not just because it is inexpensive.

- Could digital networks today play the same role for “Mail Art,” or would that change its meaning?
- Does Carrión’s idea that mail is “support” rather than “medium” make sense to you? Why or why not?

Week 3 - Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully

Laurel Schwulst reframes the website as a living place—room, shelf, plant, garden, even puddle—arguing that making and tending our own sites is a way to resist platform logics that optimize for advertising and anxiety. The metaphors matter: if the web is a river and your site a house on its bank, then your ongoing attention shapes both the space and your identity. This pushes back against the “cloud” abstraction; instead of a monolith, the web becomes many small, cared-for nodes where links are the oxygen and maintenance is a creative act.

Édouard U. extends that care inward, proposing “personal knowledge networks” as an antidote to linear, isolated consumption. Surf—don’t just search. Read multiple things in parallel; let ideas collide; trace footnotes; annotate; build Are.na channels. The point isn’t hoarding content but cultivating “personal abstractions”—structures of meaning that emerge from connections you actively make. Taken together, the pieces offer a gentle but radical ethic: make your own small place on the web, and use it to weave your own network of meaning—slowly, seasonally, and in public.

- If you treated your website (or any digital space you control) as a garden, what concrete “seasonal” practices would you adopt to keep it alive without turning it into an exhausting chore?
- How might classrooms or studios evaluate “networked thinking” (links, marginalia, remix) as seriously as finished outputs—without collapsing back into platform metrics like likes and views?

Week 4 - Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives

Olia Lialina’s essay shows that Geocities wasn’t just “bad design” but a lively community where everyday people learned to build the web. Its templates, neighborhoods, and tiny hacks (like spacer GIFs) shaped a unique, DIY style. When Yahoo! shut it down, many pages became “digital ruins,” revealing how fragile online culture is. The Archive Team’s rescue turned loss into a research resource, letting us study how early web design actually worked. Seeing repeated backgrounds, frames, and broken images helps us feel how the web ages over time.

- What do Geocities pages reveal about how people first expressed themselves online?
- Is it better to keep old websites exactly as they were (even if broken) or fix them so they’re easier to use today?

Week 5 - Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print

The reading argues that print and digital should not be seen as opposites but as interconnected paradigms, each shaping culture in distinct ways. Unlike music or video, where the carrier medium changed but the experience stayed consistent, the printed page is both content and display, so moving to digital fundamentally alters habits and traditions. Ludovico highlights how DIY zine culture resists the “all-digital” philosophy by emphasizing tactile, collectible objects while still mirroring peer-to-peer networks of the Internet. Hybrid publishing models like Written Images show early experiments in merging digital processes (crowdfunding, algorithmic generation) with physical books, though they remain limited by traditional materiality. Ultimately, both Ludovico and Cramer suggest that the future lies in suspending the binary of print versus digital, envisioning new forms of cultural production and political resistance that combine the strengths of both.

- How does the idea of post-digital print complicate the assumption that digital publishing will fully replace print?
- What unique opportunities—cultural, creative, or political—do hybrid publishing models open that neither print nor digital alone can achieve?

Week 7 - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook

In Alt-Text as Poetry, Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan invite readers to think of writing alt-text not as a technical chore, but as a poetic and creative practice. They argue that accessibility can be a form of artistry, where describing an image becomes an act of empathy and expression. By framing alt-text as poetry, the authors highlight the importance of language—its rhythm, tone, and precision—in shaping how meaning is conveyed to blind and low-vision audiences. They also compare alt-text to translation, emphasizing that describing an image always involves interpretation and creative decision-making rather than pure objectivity. The workbook encourages writers to acknowledge their own subjectivity, since every description reflects the describer’s perspective and cultural background. This transparency, they argue, makes accessibility richer and more human. Ultimately, the text calls for alt-text to be treated as an integral part of art and design, blending creativity with responsibility to make the digital world more inclusive.

- How does treating alt-text as a poetic or artistic process change the way we think about accessibility in digital media?
- What challenges arise when balancing creativity and accuracy in alt-text writing, and how might those tensions be productive?

Week 8 - Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital

Ramsey Nasser critiques the idea of a “universal” computer as culturally neutral by revealing how deeply English and Western assumptions are embedded in programming languages and digital systems. Through the example of his Arabic programming language "Qalb", he exposes the linguistic bias that defines who can truly “access” technology, showing that even efforts to localize computing often reinforce global hierarchies rather than dismantle them. Nasser argues that the problem is not merely technical but cultural and historical—language itself becomes a gatekeeper to participation in computing. His attempt to create a non-English programming language ultimately demonstrates that modern software infrastructures are built upon and perpetuate colonial power structures. The essay challenges readers to imagine what a truly global and equitable digital future could look like beyond linguistic and cultural dominance.

- How does Nasser’s "Qalb" reveal the cultural and linguistic limitations of modern computing?
- What would it take to create a digital ecosystem that truly transcends English and Western dominance?

Week 9 - David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design

David Reinfurt’s text explores how Gestalt psychology explains our tendency to perceive unified forms instead of disconnected parts. Referencing Max Wertheimer’s “Dot Essay,” he shows that perception naturally organizes elements into coherent patterns based on relationships like proximity and similarity. Reinfurt connects these ideas to design, arguing that visual compositions rely on the same perceptual laws that shape how we see the world. Understanding these principles helps designers create work that feels structured, balanced, and intuitively meaningful

- How does Reinfurt use Wertheimer’s Gestalt “Dot Essay” to bridge psychology and graphic design?
- In what ways can understanding Gestalt principles like proximity and closure help designers create more effective visual communication?

Week 10 - Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)

Ben Duvall talks about how graphic design has changed from modernism to postmodernism and now into what he calls “hypermodernism.” He explains that modernism was all about clarity and direct meaning, while postmodernism played with confusion and multiple interpretations. I think the author is trying to convey that Hypermodernism is about how digital media and the internet connect tons of meanings together through images and icons. Duvall uses Disney imagery as an example of how familiar symbols can hold layers of cultural and political meaning. In sum, the author shows how today’s design world mixes critique and consumer culture, creating visuals that are both overloaded and connected at the same time.

- How does Duvall’s concept of “hyperlinked signs” challenge traditional distinctions between surface and meaning in graphic design?
- In what ways does the use of Disney iconography by critical designers reflect both a critique and a continuation of capitalist visual systems?

Week 12 - Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games

This week's reading text discuss how Vera Frenkel’s "String Games" connects technology, performance, and memory in a really thoughtful way. I found it interesting how Frenkel used early teleconferencing as more than just play. It became a way to show how people can feel both connected and distant through screens. The idea of a “poetics of absence” stood out to me, showing how digital media can both preserve memories and make them feel lost at the same time. It also makes sense how Tuer links this to Frenkel’s later work Body Missing, which continues exploring how technology shapes remembrance and loss.

- How does String Games transform the idea of interactivity from technological play into an exploration of human absence and memory?
- In what ways does Dot Tuer suggest that Frenkel’s later works, like Body Missing, extend or reinterpret the themes first introduced in String Games?

Week 13 - Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed

This reading made me think a lot about how completely different “publishing” feels now compared to the older, more intentional idea of posting. Soulellis’ distinction between the post as an interruption and the feed as this endless, ambient flow really stuck with me, especially because it reflects how I usually consume media without even realizing it. I was also surprised by how much live-stream culture shapes our sense of watching and being watched, creating this weird mix of passivity and constant engagement. Overall, the reading made me reconsider how much control algorithms have in shaping what becomes public

- How can we meaningfully “interrupt” or resist the smooth flow of feeds when almost everything we encounter online is designed to keep us watching?
- As algorithmic voices become harder to distinguish from human ones, how are we supposed to evaluate authenticity or trust what we’re seeing?

Week 14 - Boris Groys - Art on the Internet

Groys’ argument about the Internet “defictionalizing” art really stood out to me, especially his point that the frame becomes impossible to ignore because we are the ones who create it on our screens. I was surprised by how strongly he connects online transparency to a kind of constant surveillance, where every click and action becomes part of the artwork’s “documentation.” At the same time, his idea that the Internet turns artistic process itself into a public performance made me think about how little privacy artists actually have now. Overall, the reading made me rethink how the Internet collapses production, distribution, and authorship into one continuous space.

- How does collapsing creation and exhibition on the Internet change what counts as “art”?
- If every online action is traceable, can an artist ever reinvent their identity?`;
